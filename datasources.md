### For the Homeless Bed Project... 

**William Moner, 4/23/2015:** I did a bit of research on some of the existing homeless bed locator apps and initiatives that have emerged from various attempts at this type of project.

First, [The Homeless Hub](http://www.homelesshub.org/) appears to be a great research starting point for best practices in this area. 

For code: 
ShelterConnect, by Ankur K. Jain, is an attempt to connect homeless shelters in LA. It seems as though this project hasn't really been updated since January 2015 with the main development occurring in June 2014. 
[https://github.com/shelterconnect](https://github.com/shelterconnect)
[http://shelterconnect.net/#/](http://shelterconnect.net/#/)
This project ended up winning $3,000 in 2014 in a [Hack for LA contest](http://www.hackforla.org/blog). 

[Sheltr](http://sheltr.org/) seems to be a mapping attempt that didn't go very far. It emerged from a hackathon in the Philadelphia area. [Sheltr Austin](https://github.com/codeforamerica/sheltraustin) branched from this as well, but the service is 404. 

In [this article about the 2011 Code for America hackathon in Philadelphia](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679530/sheltr-app-helps-you-direct-the-homeless-to-food-shelter) the app is featured. The article has links to other CfA projects, but each of those 404s when I attempted to access. **This item requires more research.**

We could learn from these. Two key points: 1) the projects are from hackathons with little follow-through, and 2) the code is fragmented and not very well documented.

### For the Food Desert Project...

**William Moner, 4/23/2015:** 

The USDA's Food Research Atlas is a good starting point for preliminary 2010 census data and API access.
